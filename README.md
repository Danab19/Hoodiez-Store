# üß• Hoodiez Store

**Hoodiez Store** is an online desktop-based application designed for a retail store that sells hoodies. This project was built to demonstrate the practical application of a wide range of programming concepts covered throughout our coursework.

Our goal was to create a feature-rich, user-friendly system that combines interface design, data handling, and robust error management to simulate a real-world shopping experience.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

The application includes several key functionalities:

* **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**
  A visually engaging interface that makes the application intuitive and easy to navigate.

* **User Interface Controls (UI):**
  A variety of controls (buttons, text fields, dropdowns) are implemented to enable smooth interaction with the system.

* **Exception Handling:**
  `try-catch` blocks are used to catch and display error messages via `MessageBox`, helping guide users when something goes wrong.

* **Save As Functionality:**
  Allows users to export and save their data through a familiar ‚ÄúSave As‚Äù dialog box.

* **Timer-Based Animation:**
  Animated components using a timer control help enrich the UI and improve user experience.

* **Data Formatting:**
  Use of `.ToUpper()` and `.ToLower()` methods ensures consistent and readable user input.

* **Form Navigation:**
  Easily navigate between different forms using `.Show()` and `this.Hide()` methods for seamless screen transitions.

* **Feedback Mechanism:**
  `MessageBox.Show()` provides real-time feedback and guidance in case of input errors or system issues.

* **Constraint-Based Design:**
  Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) principles are applied so that critical actions (e.g., submitting an order, viewing an invoice) are only possible when all required fields are accurately filled.

* **Robust Input Validation:**
  Strong input validation is built into every user interaction point to ensure data integrity and prevent invalid entries.
